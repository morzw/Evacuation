# Draft Review: Power Laws and Wars

### Q:

Nick and Seungin are studying why war severity follows a power law. There is no good model explaining why this phenomenon happens, so this paper tries to make a model that explains it.


### M:
They simulate wars with a model that models "transitions between equilibria."
I do not know what an equilibrium based model is.

In the past, a forest fire model was used, but it has too many mechanism differences to be useful. Iin what ways is the equilibrium model different?

There is also some tax and technological shift being modeled, that I do not understand how or why.

I can see a spacial model with states controlling land.


### R:
Graph placeholders look okay, hopefully the simulation has similar output :)

### I:
In process...


### Overall:
The outline looks fine, hopefully there will be more content by next week.
