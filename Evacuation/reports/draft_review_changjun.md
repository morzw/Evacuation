## Review of *Agent-Based Simulation of Wars and State Formation*

**Changjun Lim**


### Question
What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating? What question does it answer? How clear is the team's explanation?

The purpose of Richardson's paper was to analyze the relation between the frequency and severity of wars and find the power law distribution. But there is still no principals to explain it well. Cederman attempts to make the agent based model to produce the power-law graph.
Nick and Seungin implement the repllication of Cederman's model and check whether it follows power-law graph. The question they try to answer and the explanation about the background of the project is sufficiently clear to understand it.


### Methodology
Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

They built the agent based model similar to GioSim, Cederman's model. I think it is a good approach to explain how wars start and spread. But it is slightly unclear how the war starts in the model and what is the function of tax and technology.

1) I do not fully understand what is contextual activation. How does it affect the war decision?

2) Why are tax and advancements in technology needed in the model? How do they influence wars?

3) What is the meaning of tax threshold? Is it the property of the state or the cell?

4) How is the severity of wars determined?


### Results
Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The cited graphical result makes sense. It is easily understand the meaning of the graph(power-law). But it is uncertain which situation happens in maps. And I do not catch the severity of wars.(Is it the number of dead in a quarrel?)

### Interpretation
Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The replication is in progress, so there is no interpretation yet.

### Replication
Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper? 

The replication is not finished yet.

### Extension
Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly? Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I am not sure you mention about the extension from the replication of the original paper. 

### Progress
Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

The replication is not done yet, but I think the direction of the project is good.

### Presentation
Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language? Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report? Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Everything looks good to me. The goals and content of the report are consistent.

### Mechanics
Is the report in the right directory with the right file name? Is it formatted professionally in Markdown? Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors? Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

The format of bibliographies is not consistent. It is better to use the same format when you cite papers. The rest looks good.
